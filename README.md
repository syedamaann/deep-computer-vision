# Deep Computer Vision with CNNs

## Project Overview

Deep Computer Vision using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to perform tasks such as image classification and object recognition. The primary focus is on understanding and implementing CNNs to classify and detect images or specific objects within those images, using TensorFlow and Keras in a Python environment.

## Key Concepts

- **Image Classification**: Assigning a label to an image from a predefined set of categories.
- **Object Detection/Recognition**: Identifying objects within images and determining their categories and locations.

## Technical Background

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs are a specialized kind of neural network for processing data that has a grid-like topology, such as images. CNNs are used to detect and interpret complex patterns in data using the following layers:

- **Convolutional Layer**: Identifies patterns and features in the input image, such as edges, textures, or more complex shapes.
- **Pooling Layer**: Reduces the spatial size of the representation to decrease the amount of computation and weights.

### Image Data

Image data typically has three dimensions:

- Height and width of the image.
- Color channels (e.g., RGB channels for color images).

### CNN Architectures

The architecture of a CNN for this project includes stacks of Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers, followed by Dense layers for classification. The convolutional base extracts features from the image, which are then used by the dense layers to determine the imageâ€™s class.

## Implementation Details

### Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset is utilized, comprising 60,000 32x32 color images spanning 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset includes various everyday objects such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, etc.

### Model Structure

1. **Convolutional Base**:
   - Multiple `Conv2D` layers with `relu` activation to extract features.
   - `MaxPooling2D` layers to reduce dimensionality.

2. **Classification Head**:
   - `Flatten` layer to convert 2D feature maps to 1D.
   - `Dense` layers with `relu` activation, and a final dense layer with 10 outputs, one for each class.

### Training and Evaluation

- The model is compiled with `adam` optimizer and `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` loss function.
- It is trained on the CIFAR-10 training dataset and evaluated on the test dataset to measure accuracy.

### Data Augmentation

To improve model performance and prevent overfitting, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, width shift, height shift, shear, zoom, and horizontal flip are applied.

## Running the Project

Ensure you have a Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook environment set up with TensorFlow installed. Follow the code snippets provided in the earlier sections to load the data, define the model, train, and evaluate.

## Contribution

Contributions to this project are welcome, particularly in experimenting with different CNN architectures, tuning hyperparameters, or extending the project to more complex image recognition tasks.

## Future Work

- Implementing more complex CNN architectures like ResNet, Inception, or VGG.
- Exploring transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models on larger datasets.
- Expanding the project to include object detection and segmentation tasks.
